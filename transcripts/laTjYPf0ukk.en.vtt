00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
Will, it's time [Music]

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.860
Just gotta remember to breathe!
Really!?

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.480
Will?
Not his fault.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.300
This is what a hospital would look like without&nbsp;
oil and natural gas and nobody wants this.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.714
Find a different hospital.

00:00:19.714 --> 00:00:21.607
Wait, check this out. [Music]&nbsp;

00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:32.029
Baby. This way.

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:35.865
As I was saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;without oil and gas hospitals wouldn't have&nbsp;what they need

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:40.327
to keep us healthy, heal wounds,&nbsp;

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.290
save lives, and deliver little bundles of joy.

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:50.003
Products made from oil and gas are all around us&nbsp;

00:00:50.253 --> 00:00:53.640
And without them our lives&nbsp;
would be a whole lot messier.&nbsp;

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.382
You can leave now.

00:00:55.382 --> 00:00:57.050
You might want to double bag that. [Music]
